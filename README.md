# Requirements

1. Define an `Animal` with an `initialize(name)` constructor, exposing its name.
2. Define three `Lion`, `Meerkat` and `Warthog` classes
3. Implement a `#talk` instance method which returns a sentence like "Simba roars" for each animal. (Hint: Meerkats bark and Warthog grunt)
4. In another Ruby file, create an array with Simba, Nala, Timon & Pumbaa, iterate over it and `puts` the sound each animal make
5.
6. Add an `#eat(food)` instance method in Animal which returns a sentence like “Timon eats a scorpion”. Then override this method for the Lion class, and return a sentence like “Simba eats a gazelle. Law of the Jungle!”
